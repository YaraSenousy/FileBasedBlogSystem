## 🧠 What Is Logic Design?

Logic design is the process of creating circuits that make decisions using **Boolean logic**.

In short, it's how we build the brain of digital devices—from simple switches to complex processors.

Everything in your computer, phone, or smartwatch runs on **1s and 0s**. Logic design is what turns those bits into meaningful operations.

## 🧱 The Building Blocks: Logic Gates

At the heart of logic design are **logic gates**—tiny electronic circuits that perform basic logical functions.

### 🟢 Common Gates:
| Gate | Symbol | Function |
|------|--------|----------|
| AND  | &      | True if both inputs are true |
| OR   | ≥1     | True if at least one input is true |
| NOT  | ¬      | Flips the input |
| NAND | AND + NOT | True if NOT both are true |
| NOR  | OR + NOT | True if neither is true |
| XOR  | ⊕      | True if inputs are different |

These gates are used to build **combinational** and **sequential** logic circuits.

## 🔄 Combinational vs Sequential Logic

### 🔹 Combinational Logic  
Output depends only on **current inputs**.  
Examples:
- Adders  
- Multiplexers  
- Encoders/Decoders

### 🔹 Sequential Logic  
Output depends on **current inputs + past states** (memory).  
Examples:
- Flip-flops  
- Counters  
- Registers  
- State machines

## 🔢 Example: How a Full Adder Works

A **full adder** adds two bits and a carry-in, producing a sum and carry-out.

Inputs: A, B, Carry-in  
Outputs: Sum, Carry-out

| A | B | Cin | Sum | Cout |
|---|---|-----|-----|------|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |  0  |  0   |
| 0 | 1 |  0  |  1  |  0   |
| 1 | 1 |  1  |  1  |  1   |

These small components can be chained together to build full digital adders and even **ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units)**.

## 🧠 Logic Design vs Programming

| Logic Design | Programming |
|--------------|-------------|
| Hardware-level thinking | Software-level thinking |
| Parallel execution | Typically sequential |
| Needs timing precision | Abstracted timing |
| Close to silicon | Close to the user |

Want to bridge both worlds? Learn HDL + C.
